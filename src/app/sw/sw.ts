/**
 * Hand-written service worker (fr-96i), built by vite-plugin-pwa's
 * `injectManifest` strategy (which compiles this file and substitutes the
 * real precache manifest for `self.__WB_MANIFEST`). It replaces the
 * generated (`generateSW`) worker for ONE reason: composing Workbox's
 * precache with a COOP/COEP response rewrap, which is what gives the app
 * cross-origin isolation — and therefore SharedArrayBuffer for the flame
 * renderer — on a host (GitHub Pages) that cannot send those headers itself.
 *
 * Why hand-composed: only the FIRST `respondWith()` on a fetch event wins,
 * so the precache lookup and the header rewrap must share one fetch handler.
 * Workbox's usual `precacheAndRoute` registers its own listener and would
 * serve cache hits unwrapped — breaking isolation exactly when the app is
 * offline, the case a PWA exists for. Hence the lower-level
 * `PrecacheController` API (which registers no listeners) inside a single
 * hand-rolled handler that calls `respondWith` exactly once.
 *
 * The rewrap itself is modeled on coi-serviceworker
 * (https://github.com/gzuidhof/coi-serviceworker): every non-opaque response
 * — network or cache — is rebuilt with `COOP: same-origin` + `COEP:
 * require-corp`, plus `CORP: cross-origin` so the rewrapped assets stay
 * embeddable under that COEP. `require-corp` rather than `credentialless`
 * because the app is fully self-contained (no cross-origin subresources that
 * would need degrading) and Safari only understands require-corp. The
 * client-side half of the scheme — registration plus the reload-once
 * bootstrap a first visit needs before any of this applies — lives in
 * `../register-sw.ts`.
