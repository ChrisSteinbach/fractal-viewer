 * (see `affine4.ts`'s `systemIsFlat`/`isFlatTransform`, the underlying
 * flatness predicates). The final transform counts only per its own enabled
 * semantics: a disabled lens (`finalTransform` undefined) never makes an
 * otherwise-flat system non-flat, but an enabled one is checked exactly like
 * any numbered transform.
 *
 * `main.ts`'s `regenerate()` calls this once per generation and caches the
 * result (its `viewIs4D`) rather than re-deriving it in every per-frame or
 * per-pointer-move read; `ui.ts`'s `updateLabels` calls it directly instead
 * (it runs far less often), then passes the one result on to `updateLegend`.
 * Either way there is exactly one formula, so the routing decision, the
 * panel's gating, and the legend can never drift apart.
