 * The surface render's GPU sphere-tracer (epic fr-7jlk): a full-screen-quad
 * ShaderMaterial that marches camera rays against an analytic distance
 * estimator for the IFS attractor — width-4 beam inverse-map descent
 * (fr-v6yg) with REFINED sibling certificates (fr-1z6p: fr-beck's measured
 * ghost-eliminator ported down from the 4D tracer, closing the smooth
 * "balloon" membranes the plain certificates rendered across attractor
 * voids), precomputed by `buildSurfaceDE` (`src/fractal/surface-de.ts`)
 * and packed into fixed-size uniform arrays here. fr-jkpn's validity slots
 * ride along too — rank-3/4 candidate chains that stay live only while
 * in-sphere, closing the multi-branch drops width 2 alone still had. Hits
 * are shaded in the solid raymarcher's vocabulary — DE-gradient
 * normals, Lambert diffuse + Blinn-Phong specular, a soft penumbra shadow
 * ray toward the light, DE-probed ambient occlusion — with four base-color
 * sources (by-transform, orbit-trap palette, height ramp, radius ramp; the
 * ramps sample a 256x1 LUT built CPU-side by color.ts's ONE ramp
 * definition) and exponential depth fog toward the backdrop. Rays that miss
 * paint the same dark gradient backdrop as the explorer, so the mode reads
 * as the same scene, surfaced.
 *
 * The GLSL `surfaceDE` mirrors `estimateDistanceRefined` in `surface-de.ts`
 * line for line (the `refine === true` path of its shared descent body) —
 * the tested CPU oracle, the same discipline as `flame.ts` <->
 * `flame-gpu.ts`. Kept in its own module so `scene.ts` stays the wiring
 * layer: everything GLSL lives here, everything camera/frame lives there
 * (the scene sets `uCamPos`, `uInvProjView`, and `uPixelEps` per frame).
 * GLSL3 because the DE needs dynamic loop bounds and non-constant
 * uniform-array indexing (ES 1.00 fragment shaders allow neither); Three
 * injects the built-in vertex attributes and matrix uniforms for GLSL3
 * ShaderMaterials automatically.
